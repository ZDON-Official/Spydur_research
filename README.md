# About

---

This project is an implementation of a website for finding on campus research opportunities. Our motivation for creating this website was to streamline the process of applying for on campus summer research. Instead of having to reach out to individual professors  to learn more about their research, we decided that having all the research information available on a single website will make it a lot easier for undergrads who are interested in doing research. Our target audience for this website are mainly freshmen and sophomores looking to gain experience over the summer.

This was implemented by Zohaib, Alex, and Grant. This is version 1.0.0 of the project
